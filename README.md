# 💼 Employment History

## Full Stack Developer at Twente Academy, Enschede

students. I worked on their custom management software in PHP/Zend
Framework.
This was my first programming gig!

## Front End Developer at Wirelab - Digital Agency, Amsterdam

At this digital agency is where I unknowingly started specializing in front end
development. I mostly used vanilla HTML and CSS.

From this point onward I have been working as a freelance developer.
At this digital agency I further developed my specialization in front end
development using mostly HTML, LESS and SASS and good old jQuery.
Various small projects over the course of 4 years.

## Freelance Full Stack Developer at Rijkswaterstaat, Utrecht

_March 2016 — May 2016_\
For the ministry of infrastructure and water management I developed a user
interface for one of their database utilities used in construction. This was
my first job using (at the time) a modern web framework: AngularJS. In the
backend I used Neo4j, as their datamodel represented a graph.

## Freelance Front End Developer at Vodafone, Amsterdam

_November 2016 — April 2017_
At Vodafone I've worked in their online shop team for a while, squashing
bugs, developing new features and making some architectural changes to
the codebase. Using mostly HTML/CSS, Grunt, LESS and SASS.

## Freelance Front End Developer at Deutsche Glasfaser, Hilversum

_September 2017 — December 2017_
At this small telecom company from Germany I redesigned and developed
their Smart TV/Android/iPhone App for watching TV over internet. They were
using Google Closure for the app, and so did I.

## Freelance Front End Developer at Ticombo, Remote

_August 2017 — December 2017_
Ticombo is a ticket-marketplace startup. Their app is built using Angular
(4+), and I worked here for a while to support their in-house (but remote) development team.
It was great to experience working in a fully remote team with people from
all over the world.

## Freelance Front End Developer at VodafoneZiggo, Utrecht

_June 2018 — June 2020_\
Vodafone is merging with Ziggo (a dutch
